## Hello!

I am a human being, who probably does not live in _your_ walls. I have mediocre programming skills, but enjoy pretending that I know what I'm doing while fixing someoneâ€™s printer.

### Who are you? 

Jacat, as well as any combination of <letterr> <!, ^, *, -, +, =, or /> <number between 0-9> (most notably, c+1 and s/4). If you want to find me anywhere, try some of those names.
