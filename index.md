```markdown
import random
import string
letter = random.choice(list(string.ascii_lowercase))
operator = random.choice(["!", "^", "*", "-", "+", "/"])
number = random.choice(range(10))
if letter == "c":
    operator = "+"
    number = 1
elif letter == "s":
    operator = "/"
    number = 4
print(f"{letter}{operator}{number}")
```
